# Add your Title here âœ…
=> Choose a self-explaining name for your project and add a little description

=> Use "Windows" + "." to add emojis to your title ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Š

=> The third symbol from right on top (with a magnifier symbol) in VSC shows you the preview

=> If you want to know more about design Elements of a README: [MARKDOWN CHEAT SHEET](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

<br />
<br />

***
## Style Elements âœ…ðŸŽ¨
---
=> Colour up your text with <span style="color:red">THIS</span>

=> Use different fonts such as <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:1em;">THIS</span>

=> More than TWO SPACE CHARACTERS will create a: 

word wrap!

=> Use these brakes to generate SPACING: ```<br />```
<br />
<br />
<br />

***
## Installation âœ…
***
 
=> Use external sites to refer on informations you got from other web pages such as this [example here.](https://example.com/)

```bash
example guides (if you integrate it into a bash, others can copy this statement)
```
=> Listing some specific steps to guarantee a perfect guidance. 
```
$ git clone https://example.com
$ cd ../path/to/the/file
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
=> If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a ```Requirements``` subsection.

<br />
<br />

***
## Code and Syntax highlighting âœ…
***
=> Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks. Either you fence a word to highlight it, you fence a whole block of words or you go all in: Fence the desired part and add the suitable language to highlight it the best way as possible:
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
```python
import dogbar

dogbar.pluralize('shiba') # returns 'shibas'
dogbar.singularize('akitas') # returns 'akita'
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

=> You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
